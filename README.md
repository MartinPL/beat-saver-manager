# Beat Saver Manager

## WIP && On hold

The idea was to create frontend to beatsaver.com that can download and unzip playlist in VR browser (for Mutrix on Pico 4), but then I realized that Android Chrome doesn't support File API yet.

## ðŸ§ž Development

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                  |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                   |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server                 |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/` |

TODO
